# Grade_Sheet_Analysis
One of the jobs that all teachers have in common is evaluating students. 
Whether we use exams, homework assignments, quizzes, or projects, we usually have to turn studentsâ€™ scores into a letter grade at the end of the term. 
This often involves a bunch of calculations that we might do in a spreadsheet. 
Instead, we can consider using Python and pandas. One problem with using a spreadsheet is that it can be hard to see when you make a mistake in a formula. 
To solve this problem, we can use Python and pandas to do all our calculations & find and fix those mistakes much faster.
